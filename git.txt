It allows multiple people to work on the same project and easily merge their changes together. 
It keeps a history of all the changes, so you can go back to an earlier version if needed. 
Git also makes it easy to collaborate by allowing you to share your code with others through remote repositories. 
Overall, Git makes it easier to work on projects with others, keep track of changes, 
and maintain a reliable and organized codebase.
